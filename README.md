Play all 3 violin parts to Pachelbel's Canon by yourself!

**Wired headphones are highly recommended**, to isolate speaker output from mic input (thus headphones) and provide zero-lag audio (thus wired).
For macOS, must be run in Terminal for mic access

Fun fact: The cello part is hardcoded with just 9 lines of code.
